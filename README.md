# Smart-Class-Attendance-System
The Smart Class Attendance System automates attendance using a webcam on the smart board. It detects and recognizes student faces in real time, counts unique individuals per period, logs data with timestamps, and notifies mentors via email or SMS. This ensures accurate, efficient, and seamless attendance tracking.
